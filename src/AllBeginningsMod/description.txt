The All Beginnings Mod takes heavy inspiration from H. P. Lovecraft, with a scope of surrealism and mystic terror in mind, though with bits of miscellaneous content pieces spread around to give it some more live feeling. Overall a content mod, but with nice tiny features spread all around to make our experience far more unique from other mods.
